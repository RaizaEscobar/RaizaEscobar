### Hi, I am Raiza! :blush: :computer:

I am an enthusiastic and proactive Web Developer, with experience in Banking, specialized in International Trade. I have always been interested in the technology industry and that is why I decided to start a new career in IT. I started doing online courses on my own and I liked it more and more, so I decided to enroll in IronHack to do the Full Stack Development Bootcamp, where I improved my knowledge to become a Frontend Developer through React, JS, CSS, Html. Right now, I am very proud of my progress and I am looking for ways to add value as a Web Developer and be part of a team to learn and grow together.
